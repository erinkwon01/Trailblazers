Thank you for looking through my code and project! 
This was my (Erin) first attempt at coding a huge project, and we decided to make a travel website filled with fun facts, hotels, etc.! 
We were really surprised by how much work goes into coding when you start from scratch, but we had a lot of fun :) !
When we created this website, we knew that it would be an ongoing work in progress, filled with more opportunities to add more to each location, so there are some incomplete parts.

*In order to see all the pictures and enable your laptop to view and process the code, please download the code before clicking on the index.html from the downloaded code to access our site!*

**I recommend viewing Kyoto, Busan, Seoul, Antananarivo, Buenos Aires, Lima, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santorini, and Tokyo!**

Once again, thank you for visiting!!
